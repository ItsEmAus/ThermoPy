# Introduction

Thank you for taking the time to view my application. This repository contains a pair of files which I believe are emblematic of my approach to programming and the ways in which I have learnt how to program.

# Thermo.py

This file, while very poorly maintained, is a sample of my python programming. It was written as needed to assist with the calculations for a university course I had completed prior to cancelling my enrolment. I hadn't quite gotten a handle on the correct use of functional programming, so the <em>vast</em> majority of the programs length is redundant. Functions I added later in development are significantly more flexible and slimmed down, however due to poor maintenance practices on my part, the program was too bloated to slim down. This project was a great learning lesson in functional programming and the importance of clear commenting for maintenance purposes. During this project, I also learnt basic version control principles, hence the repository being titled ThermoPy.

# chuteSizeCalc.cpp and chuteSizeCalc_v2.cpp

This file is a sample of my C++ programming. While I was studying Aerospace Studies in Secondary School, we had an activity in our rocketry unit to launch eggs and safely recover them upon landing. To simplify the calculations for myself, I wrote code to do so. As a challenge, I used C++ to write the program, and compiled it into an executable to simplify running. The original version, titled <em>chuteSizeCalc.cpp</em>, is preserved as I wrote it six years ago, with chuteSizeCalc_v2.cpp being recently refactored to instead use a while loop as opposed to nested if/else statements.
